📱 Real-Time Currency App (Flutter)

A simple, clean, and learning-oriented Flutter application for tracking real-time currency exchange rates.

This project demonstrates widget architecture, theme management, Stateful/Stateless logic, REST API integration, JSON parsing, FutureBuilder usage, and dynamic list building in a practical and structured way.

The app uses a clean architecture approach by processing API data in the service layer and delivering it to the UI through model structures.

🚀 Features

Real-time currency data

Fetching data using REST API

Clear Model–Service–UI separation

FutureBuilder for async data handling

Responsive and dynamic list UI

Clean and minimal interface

Material 3 theme support

📂 Project Structure
lib/
  models/
    currency_model.dart
  services/
    currency_service.dart
  pages/
    home_page.dart
  main.dart


This structure keeps the project scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.

🔌 API

The app retrieves currency data from a third-party REST API.
The JSON response is parsed in the model layer and passed to the UI through the service layer.

▶️ How to Run

After cloning the project:

📝 Project Description (same text for LinkedIn)

I developed a simple yet clean Flutter application for tracking real-time currency exchange rates. Throughout the project, I applied widget architecture, theme management, Stateful/Stateless logic, API integration, JSON parsing, and dynamic list building in a practical way.

The data fetched from the REST API is processed in the service layer and delivered to the UI through a model structure, resulting in a cleaner, scalable, and more professional project architecture.
The goal of the app was not only to display currency data, but also to strengthen my understanding of data flow in Flutter, the model–service–UI separation, effective use of FutureBuilder, and responsive list layouts.
